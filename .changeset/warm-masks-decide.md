âœ¨ **Feature**: automatically validate schemas with Redocly CLI ([docs](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/)). No more need for external tools to report errors! ðŸŽ‰

- By default, it will only throw on actual schema errors (uses Redoclyâ€™s default settings)
- For stricter linting or custom rules, you can create a [redocly.yaml config](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/configuration/)
