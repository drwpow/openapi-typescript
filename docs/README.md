# openapi-typescript Docs

Docs site powered by [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro), a modern static site generator.

Lives at [https://openapi-ts.pages.dev](https://openapi-ts.pages.dev).

## Setup

Setup requires the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). With both installed, run:

```
pnpm 1
pnpm run dev
```

That will launch the docs site at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Editing

All content lives in the [content/](./src/content) directory, in `.md` files that should be familiar to edit to most.

For the non-markdown bits, please see the [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

## Contributing

Docs contributions are welcome! Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional assistance.
