# openapi-typescript Docs

Docs site powered by [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/), an ergonomic docs site template powered by Vite.

Lives at [https://openapi-ts.pages.dev](https://openapi-ts.pages.dev).

## Setup

Setup requires the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). With both installed, run:

```
pnpm 1
pnpm run dev
```

That will launch the docs site at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Editing

All content lives in `.md` files that feature normal Markdown content [with powerful Vitepress extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown).

## Contributing
