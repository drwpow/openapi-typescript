## Project goals

1. Support converting any valid OpenAPI schema to TypeScript types, no matter how complicated.
1. Generate **runtime-free types** for maximum performance.
1. This library does **NOT** validate your schema, there existing libraries for that (like [`redocly lint`](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/commands/lint/)).
1. The generated TypeScript types **must** match your schema as closely as possible (e.g. no renaming to `PascalCase`)
1. This library should never require Java, node-gyp, or some other complex environment to work. This should require Node.js and nothing else.
1. This library will never require a running OpenAPI server to work.
