     * <p>Attaches a PaymentMethod object to a Customer.</p>
     *
     * <p>To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we recommend you use a <a href="/docs/api/setup_intents">SetupIntent</a>
     * or a PaymentIntent with <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>.
     * These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the <code>/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach</code>
     * endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with <code>setup_future_usage</code> does not optimize the PaymentMethod for
     * future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely.
     * See <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage">Optimizing cards for future payments</a> for more information about setting up
     * future payments.</p>
     *
     * <p>To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments,
     * set <a href="/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method"><code>invoice_settings.default_payment_method</code></a>,
     * on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.</p>

     * NotificationEvent

     * object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
     * event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
     * events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
     * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
     * `charge.succeeded` event.
     *
     * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
     * resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
     * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
     *
     * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
     * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
     * from the API. We also have a separate
     * [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
     * `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
     * in your
     * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
     * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
     *
     * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
     * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
     * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
     *
     * **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is
     * guaranteed only for 30 days.

     *
     * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
     * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
     * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
     * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

     * amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
     * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
     * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
     * invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
     * customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

     * @description A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
     * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
     * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
     *
     * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
     * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
     * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
     * you through the setup process.
     *
     * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
     * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
     * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
     * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
     * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
     * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
     * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
     * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
     *
     * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
     * even as regulations change over time.

     * If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using

     * that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
     * client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
     * Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.
     *
     * Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
     * information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)

Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
           *
           * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.
           *
           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

           * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.
